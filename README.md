# Rocket Game
 
Fourth game I made learning Unity.

Game description: it is a 2.5D game (environment made in 3D, but player can only move in 2 directions), where you play as a rocket and you need to reach from point A to point B avoid obstacles. Controlling of the rocket isn't simple, there are only 3 buttons. Player can lift rocket up and rotate it left or right. If rocket touch the obstacle or the ground it will blow. There are several completed levels and uncomplited last boss fight.
